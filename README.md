# BME680 Pi Sensor Suite

A Raspberry Pi-based project for reading values from the BME680 sensor, storing them in a PostgreSQL database, and serving them through a Go-based server with a React frontend for real-time monitoring and analysis.

---

## Features
- **BME680 Sensor Integration**: Reads temperature, humidity, pressure, and air quality data.
- **Data Storage**: Logs sensor readings into a PostgreSQL database.
- **Go Server**: Serves sensor data and the React-based web dashboard.
- **React Frontend**: Interactive interface for visualizing and analyzing sensor readings.

## Installation Instructions

### Requirements
Make sure the following are installed on your Raspberry Pi before proceeding:
- **Docker** & **Docker Compose**: To manage the Go server, database, and React frontend containers.
- **Node.js** & **npm**: To build and manage the React frontend.

### Steps to Set Up
1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:  
   Download and extract the repository or clone it directly:  
   ```bash

   cd <repo-name>
   ```
2. **Run the Setup Script**:
  Execute the provided script to set up and install dependencies:
  ```bash
  ./sensor.sh
  ```
3. **Access the Application**:
  Once the setup completes, access the web dashboard via the Raspberry Pi's IP address on port 3000.
  Example: http://<raspberry-pi-ip>:3000

### Usage
The system runs the following components:

Sensor Reader: Continuously reads data from the BME680 sensor and stores it in the database.
Go Server: Handles API requests to fetch sensor readings.
React Frontend: A web-based interface for visualizing data.
